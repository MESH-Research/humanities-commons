## Contribution guidelines

Interested in contributing to Tainacan? That's awesome! :muscle: In this page, we'll talk about paths of contribution and what we consider a quality contribution.

### Our language policy
While Tainacan is a Brazilian project, we have adopted English as our primary language on development matters. Writing comments in Portuguese on [issues](https://github.com/tainacan/tainacan/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/tainacan/tainacan/pulls) is allowed as long as you provide an English translation of your comments. Writing comments in Portuguese on commits is expressively prohibited. Comments on the codebase and variable names should also be written in English only.

### Thinking about how you can contribute

Ask yourself the following questions: do you work, directly or indirectly, with cultural preservation? If yes, what do you do? If not, are you just a curious person just excited about it? What kind of skills do you have? Is there something you find fun to do you think you can shape as a contribution to Tainacan?

Free and open source projects offer a diversity of contributions options that go from direct involvement with the development of a software (submiting patches to eliminate a bug, implementing new features, creating new tests) to works related to localization (translating the software interface), design (creative works), user experience (testing new iterations of Tainacan and reporting issues), documentation (contributing to our wiki with new articles or improving existing ones) and communication (creating videos about Tainacan, giving talks mentioning it). Here, we'll talk about in particular about contributions to this repository.

### Issue system
An issue is a thread within the project's GitHub repository focused on debating bugs, feature requests or errors one may stumble upon. To gather as much information as possible and organize discussions to be clearer and more searchable, this repository has a few templates for the most common issues:

#### Bug report
If something is not working properly on Tainacan, use this template.
 
#### Feature request
If you have any feature ideas you would like to suggest to our developers, use this template.

A great issue is one that includes a concise description of errors you are stumbling upon along with crucial information such as which version of Tainacan you are using, which web browser, or which WordPress version. It's also important to search our repository for duplicatesâ€”and if you find one, opt to participate in the original discussion adding new information instead of creating your own. That will help contributors and users to keep track of a specific subject more easily.
