== Description ==

Follow members on your BuddyPress site with this nifty plugin.

The plugin works similar to the friends component, however the connection does not need to be accepted by the person being followed.  Just like Twitter!

This plugin adds:

* Following / Followers tabs to user profile pages
* Follow / Unfollow buttons on user profile pages and in the members directory
* A new "Following" activity directory tab
* An "Activity > Following" subnav tab to a user's profile page
* Menu items to the WP Toolbar

**Translations**

BP Follow has been translated into the following languages by these awesome people:
