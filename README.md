# BuddyBlock (Humanities Commons)

This is a fork of BuddyBlock 1.4, Copyright (C) 2013-2015 shanebp, PhiloPress.

The readme from that version can be found [here](readme-old.txt).

This forked version addresses an issue where the original would fail to properly
track blocked members in WordPress multisite installs. Additionally, it allows
users to block other users directly from their private message inbox rather than
having to visit the other user's profile page to block them.

This version is intended for use on Humanities Commons, but there is no special
configuration for it, and it shoud function on any WordPress / BuddyPress
install, though it has not been tested for general use.
